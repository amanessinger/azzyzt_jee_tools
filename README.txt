Azzyzt JEE Tools
################

Azzyzt JEE Tools is a collection of software tools designed to assist
software developers creating software using Java Enterprise Edition
6. It is designed to be integrated into popular Java IDEs.

Current status
==============

As of 25-MAR-2011, Azzyzt JEE Tools consists of three main parts:

1) a generator that creates so-called azzyzted projects. An azzyzted
   project is a collection of four projects, an Enterprise Application
   Project (EAR project), an Enterprise Java Beans project (EJB
   project), its client project (EJB client project) and a Dynamic Web
   Project (servlet project). The EJB project contains all business
   code, the servlet project contains REST wrappers around business
   methods, the EJB client project contains all data types visible to
   SOAP or REST clients. These three are called member projects. The
   EAR project is a container for the member projects.

   The code generator uses a project base name, a package prefix and
   an Eclipse runtime specification capable of supporting EJB
   3.1, and from that it creates the four projects. The EJB project is
   marked with a special "azzyzted nature".

2) a generator that analyzes JPA entities in azzyzted projects, and
   uses that information to create a base application. This
   application is a set of service beans exposed as SOAP and REST
   services. They offer access to the database as it is commonly used
   by CRUD applications. All generated code is in dedicated source
   folders. The generated application can be extended and the
   extensions may use generated code like DTOs as building blocks.

3) a runtime library of code used by generated applications.

Although Azzyzt JEE Tools come as a set of extensions to the Eclipse
IDE, large portions of the code are independent of Eclipse. Given a
project structure like that created by #1, #2 could be called from any
IDE and can even be used without an IDE, because it can be called as a
command line utility.

Azzyzt JEE Tools are known to work with the runtimes of

 * GlassFish v3
 * GlassFish v3.01
 * GlassFish v3.1

and Eclipse versions

 * Galileo SR1, SR2
 * Helios SR1, SR2

Eclipse is always understood as the generic bundle "Eclipse IDE for
Java EE Developers". Otehr distributions may contain the required
plugins and may work, but they were not tested.

The plugins compile on Indigo M4, but currently no plugin for
GlassFish is available for Indigo, thus the configuration has not been
tested. 

Using JBOSS AS 6.0 as a runtime, generated code mostly compiles,
@Remote annotations on generated service bean interfaces have to be
removed though, because JBOSS AS 6.0 only supports the JEE 6 web
profile. No further testing with JBOSS AS 6.0 has been done yet.

The project generator (#1) already runs with Apache Geronimo v3.0-M1,
but due to lacking support for REST, generated applications do not
compile. 

Future extensions will provide generators for additional patterns
commonly used in Java EE applications.

Contributions to Azzyzt JEE Tools are welcome. Possible areas include
support for additional Java IDEs, additional patterns, additional
runtimes, etc. Of course bug fixes are welcome as well.

Azzyzt JEE Tools were developed by Andreas Manessinger for the
Municipal Department 14 - Automated Data Processing, Information and
Communications Technology (MA 14) of the City of Vienna, Austria


Using the software
==================

Preparing the prerequisites
---------------------------

If you just want to use Azzyzt JEE Tools (as opposed to modify and
build them), the recommended way to install the software is via
an Eclipse update site. As of 29-MAR-2011, there are two update site
URLs, one for the edition used by the Municipiality of Vienna,
Austria, the other a generic version. The URLs are

    http://azzyzt.manessinger.com/azzyzt_generic/
    http://azzyzt.manessinger.com/azzyzt_magwien/

All announcements of new versions will be published on 

    http://www.azzyzt.org

When you don't see any features available from the update site, try
unticking "Group items by category". There actually is a category
called "Azzyzt", but you may see "There are no categorized items"
anyway. I believe this to be a bug in Eclipse p2.

Once the feature is installed, make sure to have a Java EE 6 server
instance configured. The server does not need to be running, but it
must be configured, in order to make the runtime available.


Creating an azzyzted project
----------------------------

Make sure you are in the "Java EE" perspective. There are three ways
to get to the "New Azzyzted JEE Project" wizard:

* File / New / Other / Java EE / New Azzyzted JEE Project
* [Project Explorer] / New / Other / Java EE / New Azzyzted JEE Project
* Ctrl+N / Java EE / New Azzyzted JEE Project

I normally use the keyboard shortcut, as this is the shortest path.

In the wizard dialog enter a project base name, a package name, and
choose the target runtime.

The project base name is a prefix that will be used for the four
projects that together make up an azzyzted project. 

The package name is actually a prefix as well. All generated Java
packages will be below this prefix.

The target runtime is a list of all runtimes used in defined server
instances. Thus if you have two servers running, one for GlassFish
3.01, one for 3.1, you will see a list of two runtimes. Choose one of
them.

If the list of target runtimes is empty, then you have not yet defined
a server. Do so from the Servers view with "New / Server".

If for example the project base name is "cookbook", you will end up
with the following four projects:

* cookbookEAR
* cookbookEJB
* cookbookEJBClient
* cookbookServlets

The EAR project is an Enterprise Application Project, basically a
wrapper around the three Java projects. The artifact of an EAR project
is an enterprise archive, for instance "cookbook.ear", and this is the
deployable application.

"cookbookEJB" is where we put all application functionality,
"cookbookEJBClient" is the EJB client project, its artifact could be
distributed in order to allow clients to call EJB functionality via
CORBA. All datatypes used as parameters or return values of EJB
service methods must be definied in the client project.

"cookbookServlets" is a Dynamic Web Project. It is used for the REST
wrappers around service methods contained in
"cookbookEJB". Additionally it can be used to add any kind and number
of servlets. Keep in mind though, that you need to put your logic into
the EJB project, in order to have the most options for accessing
it. If you stick to that pattern, you can access services via CORBA,
SOAP and REST. Accesses via CORBA and SOAP can even partake in
distributed transactions.

The three Java projects will have two source folders each. One of them
is always named "generated", that's where generated code goes. For the
EJB and EJBClient projects the other source folder is "ejbModule", for
the Servlets project it is "src". These source folders are for
manually written code.

If for example the package name was "com.manessinger.cookbook", the
following directories and files will be generated initially:

cookbookEJB
 |-- ejbModule
 |   |-- com
 |   |   `-- manessinger
 |   |       `-- cookbook
 |   |           |-- entity
 |   |           `-- service
 |   |               `-- HelloTestBean.java
 |   `-- META-INF
 |       |-- ejb-jar.xml
 |       |-- MANIFEST.MF
 |       |-- persistence.xml
 |       `-- sun-ejb-jar.xml
 `-- generated
     `-- com
         `-- manessinger
             `-- cookbook
                 `-- entity
                     `-- StandardEntityListeners.java
cookbookEJBClient
 |-- ejbModule
 |   `-- META-INF
 |       `-- MANIFEST.MF
 `-- generated

cookbookServlets
 |-- generated
 |-- src
 `-- WebContent
     |-- index.jsp
     |-- META-INF
     |   `-- MANIFEST.MF
     `-- WEB-INF
         |-- lib
         `-- sun-web.xml

"com.manessinger.cookbook.service.HelloTestBean" is the only generated
class that will ever be generated into a source folder meant to hold
manually written code. You can keep it or throw it away. It is only
generated upon project creation and is meant to make the project
instantly deployable.

The bean has one (predictable) method 

    @LocalBean
    @Stateless
    @WebService
    public class HelloTestBean {

        public String hello(String s) {
            return "Hello "+s;
        }
    }

Start the server, deploy the EAR ("Add and Remove" from the context
menu of the server) and try it via the service test client built into
the GlassFish Administration Console.


Modeling With Entities
----------------------

Upon project creation, a package "com.manessinger.cookbook.entity"
(given the example) was generated under "cookbookEJB/ejbModule". Use
this package to define your entities.

Entities have to extend "org.azzyzt.jee.runtime.entity.EntityBase<ID>",
where ID is the class of the table's primary key.

There are two ways to create entities:

* For a first cut you can choose to let Eclipse generate
  entities. Dal√≠, the mapping tool, comes with a wizard that lets you
  choose a connection (defined in the Datasource Explorer view with
  "Database Connections / New"), and it then analyzes tables defined
  in the corresponding database schema. Start the wizard via 

    "JPA Tools / Generate Entities from Tables"

  from the EJB project's context menu.

  In this graphical tool you can choose the tables to be mapped,
  create associations and/or choose from those automatically
  discovered, set defaults for the mapping of all tables, and finally
  specify the mappings on a per-table basis.

  This is the preferred way if the database already exists. The only
  problem is, that the wizard can't properly cope with @ManyToMany
  associations. It should, but errors in the code lead to errors in
  the generated entities. Still, for medium to large databases, this
  saves a lot of work. Just insert the @ManyToMany associations
  manually. 

* If the database does not already exist, it can be generated from
  manually written entities. Just write your entities and then
  generate the database schema with

    "JPA Tools / Generate Tables from Entities"

  again from the EJB project's context menu. Make sure that the EJB
  project is already associated with a database connection. If not, open
  the properties of the EJB project and choose a connection under 

    "Java Persistence / Connection"



Developing or modifying Azzyzt JEE Tools
========================================

Getting the source
------------------

Azzyzt JEE Tools have their home on GitHub under 

    https://github.com/amanessinger/azzyzt_jee_tools


Directory layout
----------------

Azzyzt JEE Tools are organized as a collection of Java projects. The
projects were created using Eclipse Helios, and all development on
Azzyzt JEE Tools is done with Eclipse.

The recommended way to build Azzyzt JEE Tools, is to fork the project
from GitHub (https://github.com/amanessinger/azzyzt_jee_tools) 
and use the resulting working directory as an Eclipse workspace. 
Doing so, you will end up with the following structure:

.git/                                          # local Git repository
.gitignore                                     # list of ignored files
README.txt                                     # this file
LICENCE.txt                                    # text version of EUPL
azzyzt_magwien/                                # update site project for Municipality of Vienna
azzyzt_generic/                                # generic update site project
org.azzyzt.jee.mwe.generic.feature/            # Eclipse feature (generic)
org.azzyzt.jee.mwe.magwien.feature/            # Eclipse feature for Municipality of Vienna
org.azzyzt.jee.runtime/                        # runtime libs for generated apps
org.azzyzt.jee.runtime.site.generic/           # generic site-specific runtime EJB
org.azzyzt.jee.runtime.site.generic.fragment/  # plugin fragment for generic site-specific runtime EJB
org.azzyzt.jee.runtime.site.magwien/           # site-specific runtime EJB for Municipality of Vienna
org.azzyzt.jee.runtime.site.magwien.fragment/  # plugin fragment for site-specific runtime EJB for Municipality of Vienna
org.azzyzt.jee.tools.common.plugin/            # plugin with plugin support code
org.azzyzt.jee.tools.mwe/                      # code generator for Modeling With Entities
org.azzyzt.jee.tools.mwe.projectgen.plugin/    # Eclipse plugin for creating azzyzted projects
org.azzyzt.jee.tools.project.plugin/           # Eclipse plugin with code for creating faceted projects

Additionally you may find a directory named ".metadata" in case
you actually use the working directory as an Eclipse workspace.

If you don't work for the Municipality of Vienna, you can safely
ignore everything with "magwien" in its name.


Building the software
---------------------

Start Eclipse and open the new workspace. Don't import the projects
yet. In order to compile the source, you need a Java EE 6 runtime, for
instance GlassFish v3.1, the current version as of Spring 2011.

Install the Oracle GlassFish plugin if you have not done so, download
and install GlassFish if you have not done so, and then create a new
server instance ("[Servers View] / New / server").

At this point the build will likely fail. Look at the libraries in the
build path. The server runtime will likely be unbound. Bind it to the
runtime of your newly created server instance.
