* Azzyzt JEE Tools
#OPT: plain!

 !!! Release {version}

Azzyzt JEE Tools is a collection of software tools helping software
developers to create software using Java Enterprise Edition 6. It is
designed to be integrated into popular Java IDEs.

This file is a tutorial for users of Azzyzt JEE Tools.

* Using Azzyzt JEE Tools

If you just want to use Azzyzt JEE Tools (as opposed to modify and
build them), the recommended way to install the software is via
an Eclipse update site. As of release {version}, there are two update site
URLs, one for the edition used by the Municipiality of Vienna,
Austria, the other a generic version. The URLs are

    [[http://azzyzt.manessinger.com/azzyzt_generic/]]

    [[http://azzyzt.manessinger.com/azzyzt_magwien/]]

All announcements of new versions will be published on 

    [[http://www.azzyzt.org]]

When you don't see any features available from the update site, try
unticking "Group items by category". There actually is a category
called "Azzyzt", but you may see "There are no categorized items"
anyway. I believe this to be a bug in Eclipse p2.

Once the feature is installed, make sure to have a Java EE 6 server
instance configured. The server does not need to be running, but it
must be configured, in order to make the runtime available.

If you want to dig deeper, make your own changes, want to supply
patches, etc, the complete sources are available on \GitHub under

    [[https://github.com/amanessinger/azzyzt_jee_tools]]


* The cookbook example

If you remember my
[[http://programming.manessinger.com/tutorials/an-eclipse-glassfish-java-ee-6-tutorial/][Eclipse / \GlassFish / Java EE 6 Tutorial]], 
here we will use more or less the same application, just slightly
expanded to show off some new features. All subsequent examples will
reference the same database and the same entities.

In the following I frequently reference a subdirectory ''doc'' of the
[[https://github.com/amanessinger/azzyzt_jee_tools][Azzyzt source
distribution]]. For your convenience and if you don't want to fork the
source distribution, a compressed archive of this directory (including
the sample sources) is available under

    [[http://azzyzt.manessinger.com/doc.zip]]

and additionally the extracted content is available under

    [[http://azzyzt.manessinger.com/doc/]]

If you want to follow the examples given, you should first set up a
database. The subdirectory ''doc/cookbook'' of the Azzyzt source
distribution contains a file ''README.txt''. Follow the directions
therein.

On the same level as ''README.txt'' you find one directory for each
database that the tutorial supports. Note, it's not that Java EE 6 or
\GlassFish or Azzyzt don't support other databases, it's just that I've
not tested the tutorial with anything else.

Each database subdirectory contains a set of SQL instructions on how
to create the database user, the database, and scripts to create the
schema objects (tables and sequences), to initialize the tables, and
finally to drop the schema objects if you want to start over.

Furthermore there is a directory ''src/base'', that contains the
sources of entity classes and a ''persistence.xml'', that already
references these classes. More about that in the next couple of
sections. Another directory ''src/optional'' contains the sources of
the JUnit test that I use.

Finally ''doc/cookbook'' contains a soapUI project file. This already
contains the REST requests for the examples at the end of this
tutorial.


** Creating an azzyzted project

Make sure you are in the "Java EE" perspective. There are three ways
to get to the "New Azzyzted JEE Project" wizard:

 - __File / New / Other / Java EE / New Azzyzted JEE Project__
 - __\[Project Explorer\] / New / Other / Java EE / New Azzyzted JEE Project__
 - __''Ctrl+N'' / Java EE / New Azzyzted JEE Project__

I normally use the keyboard shortcut, as this is the shortest path.

In the wizard dialog enter a project base name, a package name, and
choose the target runtime.

The project base name is a prefix that will be used for the four
projects that together make up an azzyzted project. 

The package name is actually a prefix as well. All generated Java
packages will be below this prefix.

The target runtime is a list of all runtimes used in defined server
instances. Thus if you have two servers supporting Java EE 6 running
or at least defined in Eclipse, one for \GlassFish 3.01, one for 3.1,
you will see a list of two runtimes. Choose one of them.

If the list of target runtimes is empty, then you have not yet defined
a server. Do so from the Servers view with "__New / Server__".

In the context of this tutorial, the project base name is
"''cookbook''", the package name is
"''com.manessinger.cookbook''". Try this and you will end up with the
following five projects:

 - ''azzyzt_tools''
 - ''cookbookEAR''
 - ''cookbookEJB''
 - ''cookbookEJBClient''
 - ''cookbookServlets''

"''azzyzt_tools''" is used by Azzyzt itself. In a later version it
will become useful for you as well, for now I ask you to simply let it
alone :)

The EAR project is an Enterprise Application Project, basically a
wrapper around the three server-side Java projects. The artifact of an
EAR project is an enterprise archive, for instance
"''cookbookEAR.ear''", and this is the deployable application.

"''cookbookEJB''" is where we put all application functionality,
"''cookbookEJBClient''" is the EJB client project, its artifact could
be distributed in order to allow clients to call EJB functionality via
CORBA. All datatypes used as parameters or return values of EJB
service methods must be definied in the client project.

"''cookbookServlets''" is a Dynamic Web Project. It is used for the
REST wrappers around service methods contained in
"''cookbookEJB''". Additionally it can be used to add any kind and
number of servlets. Keep in mind though, that you need to put your
logic into the EJB project, in order to have the most options for
accessing it. If you stick to that pattern, you can access services
via CORBA, SOAP and REST. Accesses via CORBA and SOAP can even partake
in distributed transactions.

The three Java projects will have two source folders each. One of them
is always named "''generated''", that's where generated code goes. For
the EJB and EJBClient projects the other source folder is
"''ejbModule''", for the Servlets project it is "''src''". These
source folders are for manually written code.

In our case the following directories and files will be generated
initially:

---

"''com.manessinger.cookbook.service.HelloTestBean''" is one of the two
generated classes that will ever be generated into a source folder meant
to hold manually written code. You can keep it or throw it away. It is
only generated upon project creation and is meant to make the project
instantly deployable and callable.

The bean has one (predictable) method 
#Code id=HelloTestBean syntax=Java <<---
@LocalBean
@Stateless
@WebService
public class HelloTestBean {

    public String hello(String s) {
        return "Hello "+s;
    }
}
---

Start the server, deploy the EAR ("__Add and Remove__" from the context
menu of the server) and try it via the service test client built into
the \GlassFish Administration Console.

The second class that is generated into the user folder is
"''com.manessinger.cookbook.meta.Azzyztant''". It is explained later,
when we talk about customization.


** Azzyzted Modeling With Entities

Upon project creation, a package "''com.manessinger.cookbook.entity''"
(given the example) was generated under
"''cookbookEJB/ejbModule''". Use this package to define your entities.

Entities have to extend
"''org.azzyzt.jee.runtime.entity.EntityBase<ID>''", where ID is the
class of the table's primary key.

There are two ways to create entities:

 - For a first cut you can choose to let Eclipse generate
   entities. Dali, the mapping tool, comes with a wizard that you can
   run on the connection associated with an EJB project. In order to
   do this, the connection must have been defined in the Datasource
   Explorer view with "__Database Connections / New__" and it must
   have been associated with the EJB project via "__Properties / Java
   Persistence / Connection__".

   The wizard analyzes tables defined in the corresponding database
   schema. Start the wizard via "__JPA Tools / Generate Entities from
   Tables__" from the EJB project's context menu.

   In this graphical tool you can choose the tables to be mapped,
   create associations and/or choose from those automatically
   discovered, set defaults for the mapping of all tables, and finally
   specify the mappings on a per-table basis. You can even specify for
   the generated entities to extend the required superclass.

   This is the preferred way if the database already exists. The only
   problem is, that the wizard can't properly cope with ''@\ManyToMany''
   associations. It should, but errors in the code lead to errors in
   the generated entities. Still, for medium to large databases, this
   saves a lot of work. Just insert the ''@\ManyToMany'' associations
   manually.

 - If the database does not already exist, it can be generated from
   manually written entities. Just write your entities and then
   generate the database schema with "__JPA Tools / Generate Tables
   from Entities__", again from the EJB project's context menu. Make
   sure that the EJB project is already associated with a database
   connection. If not, open the properties of the EJB project and
   choose a connection under "__Java Persistence / Connection__". I'm
   sorry to say that this may fail (due to tool errors) in some
   perfectly legal cases as well, and one of those cases, the mapping
   of a many-to-many association where the join table has additional
   attributes and does not feature a separate id, is part of the
   tutorial. 

Whichever way you go, be prepared to have to do some manual work in
this phase. Those problems have been in Dali for quite some time and I
have not seen any progress in a year. On the other hand, creating the
entities or database schemata is definitely not in the scope of Azzyzt
JEE Tools. Eclipse Indigo could have changed this, but so far I did
not find time to try it.

Note please, that __Azzyzted Modeling With Entities__ only supports mapping
annotations on fields, not on accessor methods. This is not a deeply
rooted design decision but just a matter of how it was
implemented. Though it would be principally possible to support
annotations of accessor methods, I currently see no reason to do
so. The general consensus among experts seems to be, that none of the
two methods has substantial advantages over the other. 

Personally I feel that annotating the fields makes it easier to get an
overview, and besides it does not tempt the developer to introduce
side effects into getters/setters.


*** Azzyzt-specific annotations

Azzyzt introduces the following extra annotations, that can be used on
entity fields:

  ''@Internal'' :: marks a field as internal. It is mapped, but not
      exposed to service clients.

  ''@\CreateTimestamp'', ''@\ModifyTimestamp'' :: marks a field as
      create/modify timestamp. Field types can be Calendar, Date or
      String. In case it is a string, the annotations need an
      attribute "format", and that string has to be a valid format for
      ''java.text.SimpleDateFormat''

  ''@\CreateUser'', ''@\ModificationUser'' :: marks a string field as user
      name. Determining a user name is by definition a highly
      site-specific thing, thus we rely on some ''InvocationMetaInfo''
      being generated at the entry point into the service, and being
      passed on via the standard
      ''javax.transaction.TransactionSynchronizationRegistry''

      As of release {version} this is only partially implemented. It
      works for REST but not for SOAP and CORBA, and from a service
      accessed via REST, it currently wouldn't be passed on to backend
      services accessed via REST or SOAP. The crucial knowledge about
      how to extract user information from a
      ''javax.interceptor.InvocationContext'' is left to a standalone
      EJB that I call a \SiteAdapter. Azzyzt comes with a site adapter
      that uses information supplied in an HTTP header called
      "''x-authenticate-userid''", thus it relies on some
      authenticating portal or gateway in front of the application
      server. Later on we will see how to configure this.

*** Sample entities

Remember the folder ''doc/cookbook/src''? For your convenience I have
already provided entities and a ''persistence.xml'', that match the
sample databases.

Note that the entities work with Postgresql as well as with
Oracle. There is nothing that prevents you from writing entities
specific to a certain database system, but on the other hand you
should not need to. Try to stay database-agnostic if you can, it gives
you one dependency less to care about.

                    `-- entity
                        `-- VisitId.java
---

In order to use the entities, just copy the two folders

 - ''cookbookEJB''
 - ''cookbookEJBClient''

into your workspace and then refresh the projects in Eclipse. Most
likely an error symbol will be shown on the EJB project. Don't worry,
use "__Project / Clean ... / Clean all projects__" and it will go
away. I believe this to be an error in Eclipse. 

The sample database is pretty simple. We have have countries, cities,
zips, visits from a zip code area to a certain city, guided using a
certain language, and all languages used by guides. 

A __Country__ has cities and each __City__ is in a certain country. A
country has a number of __Zip__ areas and each ZIP area belongs to a
certain country. ZIPs don't necessarily correspond to
cities. __Country__, __City__ and __Zip__ are easy cases. The
corresponding tables each have an ID taken from a sequence, and the
only relationships that we need to map, can be modeled using
''\@OneToMany'' and ''\@ManyToOne''.

**** A complicated association

__Visit__ is a more complicated case. It maps a three-ended
many-to-many association between __City__, __Zip__ and __Language__. A
city can be the target of visits from many ZIP areas and different
people from a certain ZIP area will visit many cities.

Although JPA supports ''\@ManyToMany'', we can't use
it. ''\@ManyToMany'' is for mapping an association between only two
entities and also assumes a simple join table containing no extra
attributes. In such a case, for instance between only __City__ and
__Zip__, the join table would not need to be mapped at all, we would
just have to map the ''\@ManyToMany'' associations in __City__ and
__Zip__.

When a join table has additional attributes, you always need to map it
as an entity. This is easiest when it has its own ID attribute,
preferrably taken from a sequence as well. Then you just have to treat
it like any other entity.

Unfortunately both things are rare in legacy databases. Join tables
frequently have additional attributes, and the concept of an extra ID
on the join table looks extremely alien outside of the realm of
object-relational mapping.

To cover this common and not well documented case (at least it took me
some time to find anything on the Internet and figure it out),
__Visit__ has an extra attribute ''Long totalNumberOfVisitors'' that acts
as a counter. Think of a system where we have to collect some
anonymized statistics about visits and langauges. 

The corresponding database table has no explicit ID, thus we have to
use the idiom of an __embedded ID__. The embedded ID is a separate
class __\VisitId__ in the client project. It's in the client project,
because we will have to pass it around as parameter.

Look at the class ''Visit'' and note that it has an ID defined as

#Code id=EmbeddedId syntax=Java <<---
@EmbeddedId private VisitId id;
---

with the getter and setter defined like

#Code id=EmbeddedIdGetterSetter syntax=Java<<---
public VisitId getId() {
    if (id == null) {
        return null;
    }
    VisitId result = new VisitId(id.getFromZipArea(), id.getToCity(), id.getLangUsed());
    return result;
}

public void setId(VisitId id) {
    if (id == null) {
        return;
    }
    this.id = new VisitId(id.getFromZipArea(), id.getToCity(), id.getLangUsed());
}
---

Additionally we have three ''\@ManyToOne'' associations.

#Code id=VisitAssociations syntax=Java <<---
@Internal @ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name="from_zip_area", insertable=false, updatable=false)
private Zip fromZipArea;

@Internal @ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name="to_city", insertable=false, updatable=false)
private City toCity;

@Internal @ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name="lang_used", insertable=false, updatable=false)
private Language languageUsedByGuide;
---

We have explicitly named the join columns, because their names can't
be guessed automatically by JPA. We have also marked them as neither
insertable nor updatable, because the attributes that get actually
written to the database are inside the embedded ID class ''VisitId''.

We have also used Azzyzt's ''@Internal'' annotation, thus these
association attributes will not be contained in generated DTOs (but
the embedded ID will). The three association attributes just need to
be there to give us the information, that there is an association at
all.

''\VisitId'' is a class with IDs only. It starts like this:

#Code id=VisitId syntax=Java <<---
@XmlRootElement(name="visitId")
@Embeddable
public class VisitId implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Column(name="from_zip_area", nullable = false)
    private Long fromZipArea;

    @Column(name="to_city", nullable = false)
    private Long toCity;

    @Column(name="lang_used", nullable = false)
    private String langUsed;

    ...
---

Note that ''\VisitId'' is a DTO, and thus it is annotated with
''\@XmlRootElement''. It is also used as an embedded Id, thus JPA
requires the annotation ''@Embeddable''.

Here is a case where we directly use part of an entity as a DTO, but
if you think about it, this is only a generalization. For ''Visit'',
''\VisitId'' is the type of its ID, and we always expose the type of
IDs, only that the type is normally ''Long'' and therefore does not
look suspicious.

In order to be able to use ''\VisitId'' as a JPA entity's ID, we have
to define ''hashCode()'' and ''equals()'', thus I have generated them
in Eclipse using "__Source / Generate hashCode() and equals
...__". 

''\VisitId'' is not an entity class, but it must be contained in
''persistence.xml''. If it is not, you get a funny error in ''Visit'',
stating that "__\VisitId is not mapped as embeddable__", which is
clearly wrong. The ''@Embeddable'' annotation is there, only the error
message is wrong, it would have to be "__\VisitId is not contained in
the persistence unit__" or something like that.

Also note the two constructors. For the purpose of serialization we
need a parameterless constructor, for ''getId()'' and ''setId()'' in
''Visit'', we need a constructor with values for the three fields.

In ''City'' we have one opposite end of the association

#Code id=CityVisits syntax=Java <<---
@OneToMany(mappedBy="toCity")
private List<Visit> visits;
---

the second opposite end is defined in ''Zip''

#Code id=ZipVisits syntax=Java <<---
@OneToMany(mappedBy="fromZipArea")
private List<Visit> visits;
---

and the third in ''Language''

#Code id=LanguageVisits syntax=Java <<---
@OneToMany(mappedBy="languageUsedByGuide")
private List<Visit> visits;
---

The pattern always goes like this. After the same pattern you could
have a complex relation between two or four or any number of
tables. The embedded ID always contains all ID fields (encapsulates
the foreign keys), the constructor always takes parameters for all
IDs, we always have bi-directional associations towards all
participating entities.

**** Create / modification users and timestamps

All entity classes but ''Language'' have some fields automatically set
by the code that Azzyzt JEE Tools generate:

#Code id=createModifyTimestampUser syntax=Java <<---
@CreateTimestamp
@Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
@Column(name="create_timestamp")
private Calendar createTimestamp;

@ModificationTimestamp
@Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
@Column(name="modification_timestamp")
private Calendar modificationTimestamp;

@CreateUser
@Column(name="create_user")
private String createUser;

@ModificationUser
@Column(name="modification_user")
private String modificationUser;
---

In order to demonstrate your options for timestamps, I have defined
them in ''Zip'' as ''java.util.Date''

#Code id=createModifyTimestampDate syntax=Java <<---
@CreateTimestamp
@Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
@Column(name="create_timestamp")
private Date createTimestamp;

@ModificationTimestamp
@Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
@Column(name="modification_timestamp")
private Date modificationTimestamp;
---

and finally in ''Visit'' as string. This is not uncommon in legacy
databases, and because there is no standard string representation that
we can rely on, I have decided to require the format a format string
as documented for ''java.text.SimpleDateFormat''.

#Code id=createModifyTimestampDate syntax=Java <<---
@CreateTimestamp(format="yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmss.SSS")
@Column(name="create_timestamp")
private String createTimestamp;

@ModificationTimestamp(format="yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmss.SSS")
@Column(name="modification_timestamp")
private String modificationTimestamp;
---

Create timestamps could be easily set via database defaults, for
modification timestamps you could use database triggers, but doing it
programmatically, we can make sure that they are __only__ set
automatically, it's more portable this way, and it gives Azzyzt a tad
more meta information to work with :)

**** A simple lookup table

In the case of ''Language'' I have not used automatically set
fields. The underlying table is a typical example of a lookup
table. You find that in most databases that were not explicitly
designed for access by object-oriented languages. The ID is not
generated, it is a simple string, in our case a language code like it
is used in locale specifications. The only other attribute is the long
name of the language.

Using such tables may be a tad less efficient, but it actually brings
a big advantage as well: it makes databases more readable. A foreign
key in a visit record can be understood without looking up the value
in the language table. And even if you don't agree, there is no way
around the fact that we stumble upon this pattern in practically every
legacy database.

Here we are, that's our entity model.


** Generating a base application

Once you have entities, you can generate code. In order to do this,
use "__Azzyzt / Start code generator__" from the context menu of the EJB
project. That's it :)


** Structure of the generated code

In our example, the result of code generation looks like this:

Quite a lot of code, and this is only for five tables. Imagine a real
project with dozens or hundreds of tables. Sure, this could all be
useless rubbish, so let's look at what we can do with it :)


* Using the generated code

The first step is to deploy the EAR project. Note please, that you
have to modify ''persistence.xml'' to refer to a ''jta-data-source'',
and that this data source must be defined in the application
server. The
[[http://programming.manessinger.com/tutorials/an-eclipse-glassfish-java-ee-6-tutorial/][Eclipse / \GlassFish / Java EE 6 Tutorial]] has a section titled "__Specifying
the database, testing, SQL log__", that shows how to do this in
\GlassFish. The sample ''persistence.xml'' from
''doc/cookbook/src/cookbookEJB/ejbModule/META-INF'' is already set up
correctly. In fact, after creating the azzyzted project, copying over
the enitites, refreshing the projects and rebuilding all, and then
finally generating code, you are ready to go.

You deploy the application by first starting the Server from Eclipse's
"__Servers__" view. When the server runs, select "__Add and Remove
...__" from the context menu of the server. Select ''cookbookEAR''
from the box labeled "__Available__" and move it with "__Add__" to the
box labeled "__Configured__". Press "__Finish__" and wait until
the server is synchronized. 

Now that the application is deployed, you can call the services.

For each table/entity Azzyzt has created a DTO (EJBClient), two EJBs,
one for full (rw) and one for restricted (r) access, corresponding
remote interfaces in the EJBClient project, and corresponding REST
wrappers around the beans (Servlet project). Additionally we get a
\ModifyMultiBean, a \ModifyMultiInterface and a corresponding REST
wrapper.

** SOAP

Here are some URLs of WSDLs (service descriptions of SOAP services)
for the generated service beans, assuming \GlassFish runs on port
8080:

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbook/CityFullBean?wsdl]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbook/CityRestrictedBean?wsdl]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbook/CountryFullBean?wsdl]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbook/CountryRestrictedBean?wsdl]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbook/LanguageFullBean?wsdl]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbook/LanguageRestrictedBean?wsdl]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbook/VisitFullBean?wsdl]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbook/VisitRestrictedBean?wsdl]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbook/ZipFullBean?wsdl]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbook/ZipRestrictedBean?wsdl]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbook/ModifyMultiBean?wsdl]]

You can use these WSDLs to create client stubs for access via SOAP.


** REST

Get the WADL description of the REST services from

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/application.wadl]]

Try the services for yourself, for instance with
[[http://www.soapui.org][soapUI]]. Open soapUI, create a new project
from the context menu of "__Projects__" in the tree view on the left
pane. Enter "''cookbook - REST''" as the project name and paste the
WADL URL into "__Initial WSDL/WADL__". Press "__OK__" and soapUI will
create all REST resources with one sample request each. 

Look at the generated tree. The soapUI project has one service, named
just like the project. Below this service, there are resources, two
for each entity, one named like the entity, one named with a suffix
"''Restricted''". They wrap the full and the restricted
beans. Below each resource you find the operations that it
supports. For the restricted variants these are

  ''all()'' :: Delivers a list of all objects of that class. Useful if
      you intend to put the result into a set or a map. The typical
      application would be a client-side cache of a small table of
      values used for display. This is always a GET request.

  ''byId(id)'' :: Takes an ID and delivers the object with that
      ID. For single-valued IDs this is a GET request with the ID as
      URL parameter named ''id'', for embedded IDs it is a POST
      request. 

  ''list(query_spec)'' :: Takes a __query specification__ and delivers
      all objects of the class, that match the query
      specification. This is always a POST request.

The non-restricted resources have the same operations as the
restricted, and additionally the following:

  ''store(dto)'' :: Takes a DTO and stores the corresponding object.
      If the object already exists in the database, this is an
      ''UPDATE'', otherwise it is an ''INSERT''. Store returns a DTO
      for the stored object, to give the client access to
      server-generated content (IDs, timestamps, usernames, defaults
      from the database). This is always a POST request.

  ''delete(id)'' :: Takes an ID and deletes the corresponding
      object. For single-valued IDs this is a GET request with the ID
      as URL parameter named ''id'', for embedded IDs it is a POST
      request.

Additionally there is a resource called "''modifyMulti''". It has the
operations

  ''storeMulti(dtos)'' :: Takes a list of DTOs of any kind, stores
      them and returns the same list of DTOs in the same order, with
      server-generated values updated. This is a POST request.

  ''deleteMulti(dtos)'' :: Takes a list of DTOs of any kind, and
      deletes the corresponding objects. The only requirement for the
      DTOs is to be of the correct type and have the ID set. All other
      fields are ignored. This is a POST request.

  ''storeDeleteMulti(storeDelete)'' :: Takes an object with two lists
      of DTOs, one of objects to be stored, one of objects to be
      deleted. This is a POST request.

From the operations, drill down to the generated sample requests. Each
operation will automatically have one request called "''Request 1''".

The operations mentioned so far consume (where applicable) XML input
and produce XML output. Additionally for each operation there is also
a variant with the suffix ''Json''. Thus for ''store(dto)'' there is
also a ''storeJson(dto)''. It won't come as a surprise that these
variants consume and produce [[http://json.org/][JSON]], the
__\JavaScript Object Notation__. 

* Examples for REST

I assume that you use [[http://www.soapui.org][soapUI]] to work
through the following examples. In soapUI you send a request by
opening it (double click in the tree) and clicking on the green
triangle in the upper left corner of the request sub-window. That's
all you have to do for a parameterless GET request (only
''all()''). The result of a request will always be in the right pane
of the request sub-window. The URL for the request will already be
correct, because the request has been generated from a WADL
description.

For GET requests with parameters, you already see the needed
parameters in the left pane. This is only the case for "''byId''" and
"''delete''", thus the name is always "''id''". Fill in the value,
press ''<TAB>'' to get out of the value field (important, otherwise
soapUI does not accept the value!) and send the request.

For POST requests, the left pane has an upper and a lower part. Just
copy the XML or JSON from the example and paste it into the lower left
pane. Then send the request.

For a POST request you need to set the MIME type ("__Media Type__") of
the POST data. In soapUI this defaults to "''application/xml''". For
JSON requests you have to change it to "''application/json"
manually. It is not contained in the drop-down list, but you can edit
the text.

** List of all countries

Issue a GET request to any of the following URLs:

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/country/all]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/countryRestricted/all]]

The result will be an unsorted list of all countries:

#Code syntax=XML <<---

Issue a GET request to any of the JSON equivalents:

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/country/allJson]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/countryRestricted/allJson]]

and you get the same list, but now in JSON notation:

Stop it, you say, didn't you pretend that in the JSON variant it's all
JSON?  Why XML?

Well, you still have to post the XML with MIME type
"''application/json''". Fact is, that the server expects a single
string parameter, and that this string must contain a valid query
specification in XML. Thus the XML of this string parameter is not a
matter of transport protocol, it is the payload, it is content.

This single string happens to have the same network representation,
regardless of how it is sent, as "''application/xml''" or as
"''application/json''". The only difference is the ''Content-Type''
header. Otoh, the server expects "''application/json''" and will
produce an error if it gets the wrong content type header.

But again: why XML? Why not have an alternative representation of the
query in JSON?

The reason is, that JSON is a format that's easy to turn into
JavaScript objects by calling ''eval()'' (though you shouldn't do
that), but it is not a very readable format for people. In the
following we will see some XML that could of course be expressed in
JSON as well, but that is generally more readable in XML. While
readability is subjective, it is matter of fact that XML has
wide-spread tool support (editors, syntax highlighting, validation
tools, etc), while support for JSON is comaratively sparse.

Apart from that, the generated server side would have to implement a
JSON parser for converting JSON specifications in actual queries, just
like it currently does with an XML parser. There is no clear advantage
in doing that, and therefore the specifications are XML only.


** Query with three conditions

POST the following XML document

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<query_spec>
   <expr type="AND">
       <cond type="STRING" op="EQ" caseSensitive="true">
          <fieldName>country.name</fieldName>
          <value>Italy</value>
       </cond>
       <cond type="STRING" op="LIKE" negated="true" caseSensitive="false">
          <fieldName>name</fieldName>
          <value>r%</value>
       </cond>
       <cond type="LONG" op="EQ" negated="true">
          <fieldName>id</fieldName>
          <value>8</value>
       </cond>
   </expr>
   <orderBy>
       <fieldName>name</fieldName>
       <ascending>true</ascending>
   </orderBy>
</query_spec>
---

into either of

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/city/list]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/cityRestricted/list]]

to get a list of all cities, where the country name equals "__Italy__"
and the city's name does not begin with "''r''" (regardless case, this
excludes "''Roma''"), but not the city with the ID 8 (which would have
been "''Venezia''").

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<dtoes>
   <city>
      <countryId>2</countryId>
      <createTimestamp>2011-06-15T12:59:29.061+02:00</createTimestamp>
      <createUser>admin</createUser>
      <id>5</id>
      <modificationTimestamp>2011-06-15T12:59:29.061+02:00</modificationTimestamp>

      <name>Bologna</name>
   </city>
   <city>
      <countryId>2</countryId>

Alternatively use the JSON URLs

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/city/listJson]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/cityRestricted/listJson]]

and get this result:

#Code syntax=dot <<---
{"city": [
      {
      "countryId": "2",
      "createTimestamp": "2011-06-15T12:59:29.061+02:00",
      "createUser": "admin",
      "id": "5",
      "modificationTimestamp": "2011-06-15T12:59:29.061+02:00",
      "modificationUser": "admin",
      "name": "Bologna"
   },
      {
      "countryId": "2",
      "createTimestamp": "2011-06-15T12:59:29.082+02:00",
      "createUser": "admin",
      "id": "6",
      "modificationTimestamp": "2011-06-15T12:59:29.082+02:00",
      "modificationUser": "admin",
      "name": "Firenze"
   }
]}

The XML-based query language currently supports the unary expression
of type "''NOT''", as well as the n-ary expressions of type "''AND''"
and "''OR''".

n-ary expressions may contain any number of expressions and conditions
freely mixed. There is no limit to the level of nesting of
expressions.

Conditions have a type and an operator. Supported types are

  ''STRING'', ''SHORT'', ''INTEGER'', ''LONG'', ''FLOAT'', ''DOUBLE''

Supported operators are 

  ''LIKE'', ''EQ'', ''LT'', ''LE'', ''GT'', ''GE''

where "''LIKE''" is only supported for type "''STRING''".

Field names in conditions or order by clauses can be cross-table
references in the same dotted style as they are used in the Java
Persistence Query Language (JPQL). Only references along mapped
associations are valid. "''City''" has a field

#Code id=CountryManyToOne syntax=Java <<---
@ManyToOne
private Country country;
---

and thus you can follow the association with "''country.name''".


** Nested expressions

An example of a query specification with nested expressions is this:

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<query_spec>
   <expr type="OR">
       <cond type="STRING" op="EQ" caseSensitive="true">
          <fieldName>country.name</fieldName>
          <value>Italy</value>
       </cond>
       <expr type="AND">
           <cond type="STRING" op="LIKE" caseSensitive="false">
              <fieldName>name</fieldName>
              <value>l%</value>
           </cond>
           <cond type="LONG" op="EQ" negated="true">
              <fieldName>id</fieldName>
              <value>2</value>
           </cond>
       </expr>
   </expr>
   <orderBy>
       <fieldName>name</fieldName>
       <ascending>true</ascending>
   </orderBy>
</query_spec>
---

POST it into 

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/city/list]]

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/cityRestricted/list]]

to get a list of all cities in Italy and all other cities beginning
with "l" (regardless case), but not the one with ID 2 (which would
have been "''Linz''").

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<dtoes>
   <city>

** Store a new record

So far we have not modified anything. Create and modification
timestamps have been from the time of database initialization, create
and modification user has been "''admin''", a value coded into
''initialize_data.sql'', the script that you have used to initialize
the empty tables with sample data.

In order to store a new city, use this URL

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/city/store]]

and POST an XML representation of a city, just as you may have got it
from one of the reading operations, but in input data leave the ''id''
and the server-generated fields empty. A new object will be created
and its complete representation, including server-generated fields,
will be returned. Thus POSTing

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<city>
   <countryId>2</countryId>
   <id></id>
   <name>Udinw</name>
</city>
---

may return

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<city>
   <countryId>2</countryId>
   <createTimestamp>2011-06-15T15:48:45.503+02:00</createTimestamp>
   <createUser>anonymous</createUser>
   <id>13</id>
   <modificationTimestamp>2011-06-15T15:48:45.503+02:00</modificationTimestamp>
   <modificationUser>anonymous</modificationUser>
   <name>Udinw</name>
</city>
---

The new ''id'' will have been automatically allocated from a sequence.

Let's try the same with another bogus city name, but this time in
JSON. We use

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/city/storeJson]]

and now the text that we send to the server is actually JSON, not
XML. The server does not expect a string, it expects a city object,
and it expects this object in JSON transport. Thus we send

#Code syntax=dot <<---
{
    "countryId" : "2",
    "name" : "Anconx"
}
---

and receive

#Code syntax=dot <<---
{
   "countryId": "2",
   "createTimestamp": "2011-06-15T18:05:39.272+02:00",
   "createUser": "anonymous",
   "id": "14",
   "modificationTimestamp": "2011-06-15T18:05:39.272+02:00",
   "modificationUser": "anonymous",
   "name": "Anconx"
}
---


** Update a record, specify user

*** User names

You may have noticed, that "''Udinw''" and "''Anconx''" have been
inserted with not only an ''id'' set on server side, they had also
create/modify timestamps set as well as create/modify users. Both user
names were set to "''anonymous''".

The code generated by Azzyzt JEE Tools uses an extra EJB to figure out
what the user name for a specific request is. I call this a __Site
Adapter__, because it is used to encapsulate a site's authentication
technology and policy.

The site adapter that comes with Azzyzt JEE Tools is currently only
involved for requests invoked via REST. What happens is, that the
generic code passes the request data to the site adapter, and the site
adapter tries to take the user name (which is expected to have been
authenticated and authorized for access by a portal in front of the
service) from an HTTP header. The header's name defaults to
"''x-authenticate-userid''". This happens to be what we use
internally, but the name can be overridden by setting a custom string
resource in the application server.

The
[[http://programming.manessinger.com/tutorials/an-eclipse-glassfish-java-ee-6-tutorial/][Eclipse / \GlassFish / Java EE 6 Tutorial]] has a section titled "__Configuration via JNDI Custom Resources__", that shows how to set custom resources in
\GlassFish. 

The JNDI name of the resource has to be
"''custom/stringvalues/http/header/username''", its type must be
''java.lang.String'' and it has to have a property with name
"''value''" and the value of the property should be whatever your HTTP
header is called, for instance "''x-portal-username''".

While we are at it, "''anonymous''", as the name of the username when
no header is given, is also only a default. There is a similar
override via a JNDI string resource. The name of the resource must be
"''custom/stringvalues/username/anonymous''". Again you need to define
a property with name "''value''", having the string as value, that you
want to use, for instance "''unknown''".

 !!! After creating or changing those string resources, you have to restart the application!

In soapUI you can set HTTP headers from the request window. At the
bottom of the left pane you find text "''Headers (0)''", and this text
is actually a button. Click on it and the left pane splits
horizontally. In the lower part you see an empty list of name/value
pairs.

Click the "''+''" to the left of the divider between upper XML input
pane and header list. A dialog opens to ask you for the name of the
new header. Enter "''x-authenticate-userid''" and press "''OK''". Now
the "''value''" column of the new header is active. Enter your name or
whatever you like. I enter "''andreas''". Don't forget to ''<TAB>''
out of the value field before you send the request, otherwise the
header will not be sent!

Running through our portal would always automatically set the header,
but at home or on the train I have no portal, thus I can either
manually set the header for every request, or I can fake it by setting
the string resource "''custom/stringvalues/username/anonymous''" in
the server to "''andreas''". This is what I have made while creating
this tutorial.

*** Updating the record

Then  I  issue  another store  request,  but  this  time with  the  ID
specified as  the one that  was returned for "''Udinw''".  Let's say
that instead of "''Udinw''" (which does not exist in Italy) we really
meant  "''Udine''".  It's  the  beautiful  capital  of  the  Italian
province __Emilia Romagna__. We are happy with the ID, but we want the
name to be updated.

POST the following XML

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<city>
   <countryId>2</countryId>
   <id>13</id>
   <name>Udine</name>
</city>
---

into 

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/city/store]]

to rename "__Udinw__" to "__Udine__". This is the result,
note the modification user and timestamp, while create user and
timestamp have stayed unchanged.

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<city>
   <countryId>2</countryId>
   <createTimestamp>2011-06-15T15:48:45.503+02:00</createTimestamp>
   <createUser>anonymous</createUser>
   <id>13</id>
   <modificationTimestamp>2011-06-15T18:10:34.917+02:00</modificationTimestamp>
   <modificationUser>andreas</modificationUser>
   <name>Udine</name>
</city>
---

Now let's update ''Anconx'' to ''Ancona'' via JSON. The URL is

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/city/storeJson]]

and with the input

#Code syntax=dot <<---
{
    "countryId" : 2,
    "id" : 14,
    "name" : "Ancona"
}
---

we get

#Code syntax=dot <<---
{
   "countryId": "2",
   "createTimestamp": "2011-06-15T18:05:39.272+02:00",
   "createUser": "anonymous",
   "id": "14",
   "modificationTimestamp": "2011-06-15T18:15:43.614+02:00",
   "modificationUser": "andreas",
   "name": "Ancona"
}
---



** Delete a record

Make a GET request to the following URL

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/city/delete?id=13]]

to delete "''Udine''", assuming its ID was indeed "''13''". The
result will be

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<result>OK</result>
---

and the same with the JSON URL

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/city/deleteJson?id=14]]

results in 

#Code syntax=dot <<---
{"result": "OK"}
---


** Store multiple records in different tables

Frequently one use case will generate more than one object, and in
such a case we will want to store them either all together
(transactionally safe) or not at all. As far as REST calls go, our
unit of transaction is the call itself, thus we have to transport all
objects as parameters of the same operation.

Azzyzt JEE Tools generate two stateless session beans for each table,
one for full, one for restricted access to records of that table, but
so far we have not seen anything for mixed access or for only storing
more than one object per call. The special stateless session bean
''\ModifyMultiBean'' fills that gap. It offers three operations.

POST the following XML

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<dtoes>
   <country>
      <id>-1</id>
      <name>France</name>
   </country>
   <city>
      <countryId>-1</countryId>
      <id></id>
      <name>Marseille</name>
   </city>
   <city>
      <countryId>-1</countryId>
      <id></id>
      <name>Paris</name>
   </city>
   <city>
      <countryId>-1</countryId>
      <id></id>
      <name>Rennes</name>
   </city>
</dtoes>
---

into

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/modifyMulti/storeMulti]]

to store a new country named "''France''" and three of its cities,
"''Marseille''", "''Paris''" and "''Rennes''". The result will be
something like

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<dtoes>
   <country>
      <createTimestamp>2011-06-15T18:25:41.427+02:00</createTimestamp>
      <createUser>andreas</createUser>
      <id>4</id>
      <modificationTimestamp>2011-06-15T18:25:41.427+02:00</modificationTimestamp>
      <modificationUser>andreas</modificationUser>
      <name>France</name>
   </country>
   <city>
      <countryId>4</countryId>
      <createTimestamp>2011-06-15T18:25:41.427+02:00</createTimestamp>
      <createUser>andreas</createUser>
      <id>15</id>
      <modificationTimestamp>2011-06-15T18:25:41.427+02:00</modificationTimestamp>
      <modificationUser>andreas</modificationUser>
      <name>Marseille</name>
   </city>
   <city>
      <countryId>4</countryId>
      <createTimestamp>2011-06-15T18:25:41.427+02:00</createTimestamp>
      <createUser>andreas</createUser>
      <id>16</id>
      <modificationTimestamp>2011-06-15T18:25:41.427+02:00</modificationTimestamp>
      <modificationUser>andreas</modificationUser>
      <name>Paris</name>
   </city>
   <city>
      <countryId>4</countryId>
      <createTimestamp>2011-06-15T18:25:41.427+02:00</createTimestamp>
      <createUser>andreas</createUser>
      <id>17</id>
      <modificationTimestamp>2011-06-15T18:25:41.427+02:00</modificationTimestamp>
      <modificationUser>andreas</modificationUser>
      <name>Rennes</name>
   </city>
</dtoes>
---

Note that "''France''" did not exist before this call, thus we could
not properly reference its ID (now "''4''", as seen in the
result). Thus instead of leaving the ID empty, we have used a
__negative proxy ID__. In our example we could have used proxy IDs for
all objects in the argument list. This was not necessary though. We
need proxy IDs only when we reference them from other objects in the
same call.

Proxy IDs have no meaning outside of the call. The only requirements
are, that all defined proxy IDs within a call are distinct and that
they must have been defined in the object list before they can be
used. ''\ModifyMultiBean'' does not reorder objects, it stores them in
the order they are given in the list of DTOs. Referencing a proxy ID
that has not yet been defined in the list, makes the whole call fail
with an ''\InvalidProxyIdException'', the transaction is rolled back
and nothing is stored at all.

Please note that you can freely mix inserts and updates in the same
call to ''storeMulti(dtos)''. If it has and ID and an object with that
ID exists, then it is an update, if no object with the ID exists, you
will get an ''\EntityNotFoundException'', and if you don't send an ID,
a new object is inserted.


As for JSON, it seems that we run into a problem with polymorphism
though. I would have expected an input of

#Code syntax=dot <<---
{
   "country":    {
      "id": -1,
      "name": "Deutschland"
   },
   "city": [
      {
         "countryId": -1,
         "name": "Berlin"
      },
      {
         "countryId": -1,
         "name": "Frankfurt"
      },
      {
         "countryId": -1,
         "name": "Hamburg"
      },
   ]
}
---

to be the correct equivalent in JSON, at least that's what I get when
I construct a GET operation "''List<Dto> test()''" and return an
''\ArrayList<Dto>'' with a country and three cities. 

Serialized from Java to JSON it works, but when I try to use the same
as input for a parameter that's also a "''List<Dto>''", then the client
times out, the operation in the server is never entered, and after
some time \GlassFish logs a message about having interrupted an idle
thread.

There may be another JSON input that works, but so far I must conclude
that either JSON can't deserialize polymorphic lists, or that I
trigger a bug in \GlassFish's REST library Jersey. This is with
\GlassFish 3.1, which ships with Jersey 1.5 and Jackson 1.5.5 as JSON
API. As far as I can tell from conversations on the Internet, Jackson
1.7 still has some problems, and the proposed solutions involve the
use of annotations that are not part of the Java EE 6 standard. I
guess it's simply a tad too early for polymorphic JSON input.


** Delete multiple records from different tables

The second operation in ''\ModifyMultiBean'' deletes all in a list of objects.

POST the following XML

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<dtoes>
   <city>
      <id>15</id>
   </city>
   <city>
      <id>16</id>
   </city>
   <city>
      <id>17</id>
   </city>
   <country>
      <id>4</id>
   </country>
</dtoes>
---

into

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/modifyMulti/deleteMulti]]

Again the result will be

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<result>OK</result>
---

and with only one transactional operation we got rid of France.

The problem of correct JSON input (if it exists at all) is still open.


** Store and/or delete multiple records in different tables

The third operation in ''\ModifyMultiBean'' is slightly more
complicated but also more powerful. It can insert/update/delete in one
single call. Let's re-create France by inserting it again:

One more time POST the following XML

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<dtoes>
   <country>
      <id>-1</id>
      <name>France</name>
   </country>
   <city>
      <countryId>-1</countryId>
      <id></id>
      <name>Marseille</name>
   </city>
   <city>
      <countryId>-1</countryId>
      <id></id>
      <name>Paris</name>
   </city>
   <city>
      <countryId>-1</countryId>
      <id></id>
      <name>Rennes</name>
   </city>
</dtoes>
---

into

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/modifyMulti/storeMulti]]

and expect a result like

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<dtoes>
   <country>
      <createTimestamp>2011-06-15T19:52:58.569+02:00</createTimestamp>
      <createUser>andreas</createUser>
      <id>5</id>
      <modificationTimestamp>2011-06-15T19:52:58.569+02:00</modificationTimestamp>
      <modificationUser>andreas</modificationUser>
      <name>France</name>
   </country>
   <city>
      <countryId>5</countryId>
      <createTimestamp>2011-06-15T19:52:58.569+02:00</createTimestamp>
      <createUser>andreas</createUser>
      <id>18</id>
      <modificationTimestamp>2011-06-15T19:52:58.569+02:00</modificationTimestamp>
      <modificationUser>andreas</modificationUser>
      <name>Marseille</name>
   </city>
   <city>
      <countryId>5</countryId>
      <createTimestamp>2011-06-15T19:52:58.569+02:00</createTimestamp>

      <name>Paris</name>
   </city>
   <city>
      <countryId>5</countryId>
      <createTimestamp>2011-06-15T19:52:58.569+02:00</createTimestamp>
      <createUser>andreas</createUser>
      <id>20</id>
      <modificationTimestamp>2011-06-15T19:52:58.569+02:00</modificationTimestamp>
      <modificationUser>andreas</modificationUser>
      <name>Rennes</name>
   </city>
</dtoes>
---

France and its cities have different IDs now, because IDs come from a
database sequence and sequence values don't repeat. 

Now we can delete France again and insert Egypt. POST the following XML

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<storedelete>
   <delete>
      <dtoes>
         <city>
            <id>18</id>
         </city>
         <city>
            <id>19</id>
         </city>
         <city>
            <id>20</id>
         </city>
         <country>
            <id>5</id>
         </country>
      </dtoes>
   </delete>
   <store>
      <dtoes>
         <country>
            <id>-1</id>
            <name>Egypt</name>
         </country>
         <city>
            <countryId>-1</countryId>
            <id></id>
            <name>Assuan</name>
         </city>
         <city>
            <countryId>-1</countryId>
            <id></id>
            <name>Cairo</name>
         </city>
      </dtoes>
   </store>
</storedelete>
---

into

  [[http://localhost:8080/cookbookServlets/REST/modifyMulti/storeDeleteMulti]]

Make sure the first list, the list of objects to delete, contains the
exact IDs that you got in the last step, i.e. the country ID of
"''France''" and the IDs of its cities. The Result will be something like

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<dtoes>
   <country>
      <createTimestamp>2011-06-15T20:01:33.808+02:00</createTimestamp>
      <createUser>andreas</createUser>
      <id>6</id>
      <modificationTimestamp>2011-06-15T20:01:33.808+02:00</modificationTimestamp>
      <modificationUser>andreas</modificationUser>
      <name>Egypt</name>
   </country>
   <city>
      <countryId>6</countryId>
      <createTimestamp>2011-06-15T20:01:33.808+02:00</createTimestamp>
      <createUser>andreas</createUser>
      <id>21</id>
      <modificationTimestamp>2011-06-15T20:01:33.808+02:00</modificationTimestamp>
      <modificationUser>andreas</modificationUser>
      <name>Assuan</name>
   </city>
   <city>
      <countryId>6</countryId>
      <createTimestamp>2011-06-15T20:01:33.808+02:00</createTimestamp>
      <createUser>andreas</createUser>
      <id>22</id>
      <modificationTimestamp>2011-06-15T20:01:33.808+02:00</modificationTimestamp>
      <modificationUser>andreas</modificationUser>
      <name>Cairo</name>
   </city>
</dtoes>
---

We have deleted all of "''France''" and created "''Egypt''", this time
with two cities, "''Assuan''" and "''Cairo''".

Again you can use the same operations to make updates. In fact you can
mix creating new objects and updating others, that already exist.

Each of the two lists could have been left empty, reducing the
operation "''storeDeletMulti()''" to a more complicated version of
either "''storeMulti()''" or "''deleteMulti()''", or if both lists are
empty, to a very complicated no-op.

Again the question of correct JSON input is open.

** A visit from Austria to Luxor

Remember the strange entity ''Visit''? It represents a many-to-many
association between ZIP areas and cities, meaning that a number of
visitors from a certain ZIP area have visited a certain city. The
number of visitors and the language used by the guide augment the join
table and so do our usual create/modification timestamps/users, only
that this time the timestamps are actually strings. Additionally the
join table has no explicit ID, thus we had to use an embedded ID.

Let's pretend that we just got statistical data. Five visitors from
the Austrian ZIP area Graz-Webling have visited Luxor in Egypt. The
guide's language was British English. 

We don't have "''Luxor''" so far. This is a case for ''storeMulti()''
and for using negative proxy IDs. The database was initialized to have
"''en_US''", but given Egypt's British heritage, it seems perfectly
plausible that our guide uses British English. We don't have that
language either, so we store it in the same operation. Languages have
string IDs, thus we don't need a proxy ID for the language. The only
requirement is, that it is in the list in a position before the DTO
that uses it.

POST the following XML

#Code syntax=XML <<---
<dtoes>
   <city>
      <countryId>6</countryId>
      <id>-1</id>
      <name>Luxor</name>

** Deleting the visit

We've already covered deleting multiple objects, but we had no example
with an embedded ID. Let's delete the visit to Luxor, Luxor itself and
the language used.

* Customization of the generated code

** Introducing your Azzyztant

There are cases when we want to influence either what features are
generated, or how the generated features behave at runtime. The idea
is, to create a central class, that controls both. We call this class
the "__Azzyztant__".

From release 1.2.0 on, azzyzted projects are generated with a default
''Azzyztant'' in a sub-package ''meta'' within the ''ejbModule''
source folder of the EJB project, i.e. parallel to the ''entity''
package. This is how the ''Azzyztant'' is created:

#Code id=AzzyztantAsGenerated syntax=Java <<---
package com.manessinger.cookbook.meta;

import javax.ejb.LocalBean;
import javax.ejb.Stateless;
import org.azzyzt.jee.runtime.meta.AzzyztantInterface;
import org.azzyzt.jee.runtime.util.StringConverterInterface;


/**
 * Generated class com.manessinger.cookbook.meta.Azzyztant
 * 
 * This class is only generated if it does not exist. It is intended to be 
 * modified. 
 */
@LocalBean
@Stateless
public class Azzyztant implements AzzyztantInterface {

    /*
     * At runtime, azzyzted projects ask the site adapter for the name of the 
     * user invoking a service. The site adapter is expected to return a name
     * as supplied by a portal in front of the application server, or use any
     * other site-specific means to find out who the user is. The problem is
     * that sometimes user names have special formats (like a Windows domain
     * in front of the actual user name), and some applications may need 
     * another format (e.g. without domain name). Here's your chance to step
     * in between site adapter and runtime library:
     *
     * 'usernameConverter' can be set to an instance of any class that implements
     * StringConverterInterface.
     *
     * ATTENTION: keep this stateless, fast and thread-safe!!!

** Transforming user names

The ''Azzyztant'' has a final field ''usernameConverter'' and a getter
method for it. At runtime, when the generated application tries to
determine the name of the calling user, the supplied site adapter
evaluates an HTTP header that is supposed to have been set by an
authenticating/authorizing portal in front of the application. We have
learned that the name of this header is even customizable via a string
resource definition in the server, but that does not yet mean all is
well. What about the content of this header?

In many organizations user names are prefixed by a Windows domain
("''domain\\username''"), but imagine a legacy database that is used
not only by our generated services, but also by some legacy
applications. For some reports they may want to join tables on the
create or modification user field, but expect the names to be without
the domain (or wholly in upper-case, or ... you get the problem).

What Azzyzt JEE Tools generate is an application, but it is also a
framework, and like in all frameworks, there is sometimes the need to
have a hook into otherwise fully automatic mechanisms. The site
adapter automatically determines the user's name and passes it on to
the persistence system, only that we would want a hook in between,
where we could modify the name that is passed on. ''Azzyztant'' is the
place where such hooks will be put from now on.

In our case, we want to specify a non-null ''usernameConverter''. In
order to do this, we create a class that implements the interface
''StringConverterInterface''. I suggest creating a sub-package
''util'' in the EJB project, and there we could create the converter
like this:

#Code id=UsernameConverter syntax=Java <<---
package com.manessinger.cookbook.util;

import org.azzyzt.jee.runtime.util.StringConverterInterface;

/**
 * Converter for usernames originating from clients in a Windows domain.
 * It returns the username part without domain.
 *
 */
public class UsernameConverter implements StringConverterInterface {

    @Override
    public String convert(String in) {
        int backslashIndex = in.indexOf('\\');
        if (backslashIndex != -1 && in.length() > backslashIndex + 1) {
            return in.substring(backslashIndex + 1);
        }
        return in;
    }

}
---

It has to implement the single method ''String convert(String in)'',
and in this case the method returns either the non-empty suffix after
the first backslash, or just the input. Now in ''Azzyztant'', instead
of specifying the ''usernameConverter'' as ''null'',

#Code id=UsernameConverterAzzyztBefore syntax=Java <<---
private final StringConverterInterface usernameConverter = null;
---

we specify it as an instance of our class:

#Code id=UsernameConverterAzzyztAfter syntax=Java <<---
private final StringConverterInterface usernameConverter = new UsernameConverter();
---

Please note that this is a shared instance between all threads of your
application, but of course the supplied code is thread-safe, so it
does not matter.


** Cutting back on features

Up to release 1.1.1, the generated code did not compile against the
JBoss AS 6.0 runtime, because the interfaces generated in the client
project are annotated with ''@Remote'', and ''@Remote'' is not part of
the Java EE 6 web profile. On the other hand, ''@Remote'' is only
needed if you want to call your services via CORBA/IIOP, and very
often this will not be the case. Web services are in fashion, so why
should we tie the code to \GlassFish only, just to be able to
potentially use something that we know we won't use anyway? Some users
may want it though, and thus we like ''@Remote'' on interfaces to be a
configurable feature.

The same could be said of access via SOAP or via REST. If you don't
use it in your application, why should Azzyzt generate it?

In order to cut back on unused features, you can put an annotation on
the ''Azzyztant'':

#Code id=AzzyztantAsGenerated syntax=Java <<---
package com.manessinger.cookbook.meta;

import javax.ejb.LocalBean;
import javax.ejb.Stateless;

import org.azzyzt.jee.runtime.annotation.AzzyztGeneratorOptions;
import org.azzyzt.jee.runtime.meta.AzzyztGeneratorCutback;
import org.azzyzt.jee.runtime.meta.AzzyztantInterface;
import org.azzyzt.jee.runtime.util.StringConverterInterface;


@LocalBean
@Stateless
@AzzyztGeneratorOptions(
        cutbacks = {
                AzzyztGeneratorCutback.NoRemoteInterfaces, 
                AzzyztGeneratorCutback.NoSoapServices,
                AzzyztGeneratorCutback.NoRestServicesJson, 
                AzzyztGeneratorCutback.NoRestServicesXml,
        }
)
public class Azzyztant implements AzzyztantInterface {

    private final StringConverterInterface usernameConverter = null;

    public Azzyztant() { super(); }


    @Override
    public StringConverterInterface getUsernameConverter() {
        return usernameConverter;
    }

}
---

For brevity I have removed the generated comments, but otherwise it is
the same class as generated, with one exception: There is an
annotation ''@\AzzyztGeneratorOptions'' on the class, that defined the
cutbacks. In this case we specify, that we want no ''@Remote'' and no
''@\WebService'' annotations, no REST services with JSON serialization
and no REST services with XML serialization. The resulting
applications will only be usable as building blocks for your own
classes. Add your own services and use the generated beans, converters
and DTOs.

 !!! If you turn off both variants of REST, Azzyzt won't generate the REST servlet either!

That's it so far. Additional options, not only cutbacks, will follow
in the future. In any case, the ''Azzyztant'' is the place where
options go.


* Miscellanea

** Variants of the query specification

REST is just one way to access the services. The XML format of query
specifications was chosen to be easily creatable from Adobe Flash
clients. When the services are accessed via SOAP or CORBA, the
"''list()''" methods take an object of type ''QuerySpec'' as
parameter. Alternatively a second method "''listByXML()''" is
generated, and those methods again take XML in form of a string
parameter. The XML format is the same as for REST.

      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
